/* config.h -- Configuration file for bash. */

/* This is a `minimal' configuration file.  It will create a shell without:
	job control
	aliases
	pushd and popd
	readline
	history
	restricted shell mode
	`disabled' builtins (builtin xxx finds xxx even after enable -n xxx)
	process substitution
	prompt string decoding (though variable expansion is still done)
	the `select' command */
