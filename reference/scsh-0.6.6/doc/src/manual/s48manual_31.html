<H2>Semantics of configuration mutation</H2>
<P>During program development it is often desirable to make changes to
packages and interfaces.  In static languages it may be necessary to
recompile and re-link a program in order for such changes to be
reflected in a running system.  Even in interactive Common Lisp
implementations, a change to a package's exports often requires
reloading clients that have already mentioned names whose bindings
change.  Once <TT>read</TT> resolves a use of a name to a symbol, that
resolution is fixed, so a change in the way that a name resolves to a
symbol can only be reflected by re-<TT>read</TT>ing all such references.
<P>The Scheme&nbsp;48 development environment supports rapid turnaround in
modular program development by allowing mutations to a program's
configuration, and giving a clear semantics to such mutations.  The
rule is that variable bindings in a running program are always
resolved according to current structure and interface bindings, even
when these bindings change as a result of edits to the configuration.
For example, consider the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
(define-interface foo-interface (export a c))
(define-structure foo foo-interface
  (open scheme)
  (begin (define a 1)
         (define (b x) (+ a x))
         (define (c y) (* (b a) y))))
(define-structure bar (export d)
  (open scheme foo)
  (begin (define (d w) (+ (b w) a))))
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
This program has a bug.  The variable <TT>b</TT>, which is free in the
definition of <TT>d</TT>, has no binding in <TT>bar</TT>'s package.  Suppose
that <TT>b</TT> was supposed to be exported by <TT>foo</TT>, but was omitted
from <TT>foo-interface</TT> by mistake.  It is not necessary to
re-process <TT>bar</TT> or any of <TT>foo</TT>'s other clients at this point.
One need only change <TT>foo-interface</TT> and inform the development
system of that change (using, say, an appropriate Emacs command),
and <TT>foo</TT>'s binding of <TT>b</TT> will be found when procedure <TT>d</TT> is called.
<P>Similarly, it is also possible to replace a structure; clients of the
old structure will be modified so that they see bindings from the new
one.  Shadowing is also supported in the same way.  Suppose that a
client package <I>C</I> opens a structure <TT>foo</TT> that exports a name
<TT>x</TT>, and <TT>foo</TT>'s implementation obtains the binding of <TT>x</TT>
as an import from some other structure <TT>bar</TT>.  Then <I>C</I> will see
the binding from <TT>bar</TT>.  If one then alters <TT>foo</TT> so that it
shadows <TT>bar</TT>'s binding of <TT>x</TT> with a definition of its own,
then procedures in <I>C</I> that reference <TT>x</TT> will automatically see
<TT>foo</TT>'s definition instead of the one from <TT>bar</TT> that they saw
earlier.
<P>This semantics might appear to require a large amount of computation
on every variable reference: The specified behavior requires scanning
the package's list of opened structures, examining their interfaces,
on every variable reference, not just at compile time.  However, the
development environment uses caching with cache invalidation to make
variable references fast.
