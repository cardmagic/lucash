<h1><a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;Systems programming in Scheme</a></h1><p>
Unix systems programming in Scheme is a much more pleasant experience
than Unix systems programming in C.
Several features of the language remove a lot of the painful or error-prone
problems C systems programmers are accustomed to suffering.
The most important of these features are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>exceptions
</p>
<li><p>automatic storage management
</p>
<li><p>real strings
</p>
<li><p>higher-order procedures
</p>
<li><p>S-expression syntax and backquote
</p>
</ul><p>
Many of these features are available in other advanced programming languages,
such as Modula-3 or ML. None are available in C.</p>
<p>

<h2><a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_10.1">10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions and robust error handling</a></h2><p>In scsh, system calls never return the error codes that make careful
systems programming in C so difficult. Errors are signaled by raising
exceptions.
Exceptions are usually handled by default handlers that either abort the
program or invoke a run-time debugger; the programmer can override these when
desired by using exception-handler expressions.
Not having to return error codes frees up procedures to return useful values, 
which encourages procedural composition.
It also keeps the programmer from cluttering up his code with
(or, as is all too often the case, just forgetting to include)
error checks for every system call.
In scsh, the programmer can assume that if a system call returns at all, it
returns successfully.
This greatly simplifies the flow of the code from the programmer's point
of view, as well as greatly increasing the robustness of the program.</p>

<h2><a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_10.2">10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic storage management</a></h2><p>Further, Scheme's automatic storage allocation removes the
``result'' parameters from the procedure argument lists.
When composite data is returned, it is simply returned in a 
freshly-allocated data structure.
Again, this helps make it possible for procedures to return useful values.</p>
<p>
For example, the C system call <tt>readlink()</tt>
dereferences a symbolic link in the file system.
A working definition for the system call is given in 
figure&nbsp;<a href="#node_fig_Temp_8">5</a>b.
It is complicated by many small bookkeeping details, 
made necessary by C's weak linguistic facilities.</p>
<p>
In contrast, scsh's equivalent procedure, <tt>read-symlink</tt>,
has a much simpler definition (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#node_fig_Temp_8">5</a>a).
</p>

<div class=figure align=center><table width=100%><tr><td align=center><p>
</p>
 <p></p>
<p><tt>(read-symlink fname)</tt><br>

<tt>read-symlink</tt> returns the filename referenced by symbolic link
<tt>fname</tt>.
An exception is raised if there is an error.
</p>
<div align=center><table><tr><td>
<em>(a) Scheme definition of <tt>readlink</tt></em></td></tr></table></div>

</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><tt>readlink(char *path, char *buf, int bufsiz)</tt><br>

<tt>readlink</tt> dereferences the symbolic link <tt>path</tt>.
If the referenced filename is less than or equal to <tt>bufsiz</tt> characters
in length,
it is written into the <tt>buf</tt> array, which we fondly hope the
programmer has arranged to be at least of size <tt>bufsiz</tt> characters.
If the referenced filename is longer than <tt>bufsiz</tt> characters,
the system call returns an error code;
presumably the programmer should then reallocate a larger buffer and try
again.
If the system call succeeds, it returns the length of the result filename.
When the referenced filename is written into <tt>buf</tt>, it is <em>not</em>
nul-terminated; it is the programmer's responsibility to leave space
in the buffer for the terminating nul 
(remembering to subtract one from the actual buffer length when passing it to
the system call), and deposit the terminal nul after the system call returns.</p>
<p>
If there is a real error,
the procedure will, in most cases, return an error code.
(We will gloss over the error-code mechanism for the sake of
brevity.)
However, if the length of <tt>buf</tt> does not actually match the argument
<tt>bufsiz</tt>,
the system call may either</p>
<ul><li><p>succeed anyway,
</p>
<li><p>dump core,
</p>
<li><p>overwrite other storage and silently proceed,
</p>
<li><p>report an error, 
</p>
<li><p>or perform some fifth action.
</p>
</ul><p>It all depends.

<p>
With the scsh version, there is no possibility that the result buffer will be
too small.
There is no possibility that the programmer will misrepresent the
size of the result buffer with an incorrect <tt>bufsiz</tt> argument.
These sorts of issues are completely eliminated by the Scheme programming
model.
Instead of having to worry about seven or eight trivial but potentially
fatal issues, and write the necessary 10 or 15 lines of code to correctly
handle the operation, the programmer can write a single function call and
get on with his task.</p>

<h2><a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_10.3">10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Return values and procedural composition</a></h2><p>Exceptions and automatic storage allocation make it easier for
procedures to return useful values.
This increases the odds that the programmer can use the compact notation
of function composition -- <tt>f(g(x))</tt> -- to connect producers and consumers
of data, which is surprisingly difficult in C.
</p>
<p>
In C, if we wish to compose two procedure calls, we frequently must write:
</p>
<blockquote><tt><br>
/*&nbsp;C&nbsp;style:&nbsp;*/<br>
g(x,&amp;y);<br>
<tt>...</tt>f(y)<tt>...</tt></tt></blockquote>
Procedures that compute composite data structures for a result
commonly return them by storing them into a data structure passed
by-reference as a parameter.
If <tt>g</tt> does this, we cannot nest calls, but must write the code as shown.<p>
In fact, the above code is not quite what we want; we forgot to check <tt>g</tt>
for an error return.
What we really wanted was:
</p>
<blockquote><tt><br>
/*&nbsp;Worse/better:&nbsp;*/<br>
err=g(x,&amp;y);<br>
if(&nbsp;err&nbsp;)&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<i>handle&nbsp;error&nbsp;on&nbsp;<tt>g</tt>&nbsp;call</i>&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
<tt>...</tt>f(y)<tt>...</tt></tt></blockquote>
The person who writes this code has to remember to check for the error;
the person who reads it has to visually link up the data flow by
connecting <tt>y</tt>'s def and use points.
This is the data-flow equivalent of <tt>goto</tt>'s, 
with equivalent effects on program clarity.<p>
In Scheme, none of this is necessary. We simply write
</p>
<blockquote><tt>(f (g x)) ; Scheme</tt></blockquote>Easy to write; easy to read and understand.
Figure <a href="#node_fig_Temp_9">6</a> shows an example of this problem, where the
task is determining if a given file is owned by root.

<h2><a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_10.4">10.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Strings</a></h2><p>Having a true string datatype turns out to be surprisingly valuable
in making systems programs simpler and more robust.
The programmer never has to expend effort to make sure that a string
length kept in a variable matches the actual length of the string;
never has to expend effort wondering how it will affect his program if
a nul byte gets stored into his string.
This is a minor feature, but like garbage collection, it eliminates a whole
class of common C programming bugs.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_10.5"></a>
<h2><a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_10.5">10.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher-order procedures</a></h2><p>Scheme's first-class procedures are very convenient for systems programming.
Scsh uses them to parameterise the action of procedures that create
Unix processes.
The ability to package up an arbitrary computation as a thunk turns
out to be as useful in the domain of Unix processes as it is in the domain
of Scheme computation.
Being able to pass computations in this way to the procedures that create
Unix processes, such as <tt>fork</tt>, <tt>fork/pipe</tt> and <tt>run/port*</tt> is a
powerful programming technique.</p>
<p>
First-class procedures allow us to parameterise port readers over different
parsers, with the 
</p>
<blockquote><tt>(port-&gt;list <i>parser</i> <i>port</i>)</tt></blockquote>procedure.
This is the essential Scheme ability to capture abstraction in a procedure
definition.
If the user wants to read a list of objects written in some syntax from an
i/o source, he need only write a parser capable of parsing a single
object.
The <tt>port-&gt;list</tt> procedure can work with the user's parser as easily as it
works with <tt>read</tt> or <tt>read-line</tt>.
{Note On-line streams}<p>
First-class procedures also allow iterators such as <tt>for-each</tt> and
<tt>filter</tt> to loop over lists of data.
For example, to build the list of all my files in <tt>/usr/tmp</tt>, I write:
</p>
<blockquote><tt><br>
(filter&nbsp;(lambda&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;(=&nbsp;(file-owner&nbsp;f)&nbsp;(user-uid)))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(glob&nbsp;&quot;/usr/tmp/*&quot;))</tt></blockquote>
To delete every C file in my directory, I write:
<blockquote><tt>(for-each delete-file (glob &quot;*.c&quot;))</tt></blockquote><p>

<h2><a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_10.6">10.6&nbsp;&nbsp;S-expression syntax and backquote</a></h2><p>
In general, Scheme's s-expression syntax is much, much simpler to
understand and use than most shells' complex syntax, with their embedded
pattern matching, variable expansion, alias substitution, and multiple
rounds of parsing.
This costs scsh's notation some compactness, at the gain of comprehensibility.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_Temp_10"></a>
<h3><a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_Temp_10">Recursive embeddings and balls of mud</a></h3><p>Scsh's ability to cover a high-level/low-level spectrum of expressiveness
is a function of its uniform s-expression notational framework.
Since scsh's process notation is embedded within Scheme,
and Scheme escapes are embedded within the process notation,
the programmer can easily switch back and forth as needed,
using the simple notation where possible, 
and escaping to system calls and general Scheme where necessary.
This recursive embedding is what gives scsh its broad-spectrum coverage
of systems functionality not available to either shells or traditional
systems programming languages;
it is essentially related to the ``ball of mud'' extensibility of the 
Lisp and Scheme family of languages.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_Temp_11"></a>
<h3><a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_Temp_11">Backquote and reliable argument lists</a></h3><p>Scsh's use of implicit backquoting in the process notation is a particularly
nice feature of the s-expression syntax.
Most Unix shells provide the user with a way to take a computed string,
split it into pieces, and pass them as arguments to a program.
This usually requires the introduction of some sort of <tt>$IFS</tt> separator
variable to control how the string is parsed into separate arguments.
This makes things error prone in the cases where a single argument
might contain a space or other parser delimiter.
Worse than error prone, <tt>$IFS</tt> rescanning is in fact the source of a
famous security hole in Unix [<a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-17.html#node_bib_9">Reeds</a>].</p>
<p>
In scsh, data are used to construct argument lists using the implicit backquote
feature of process forms, <em>e.g.</em>:
</p>
<blockquote><tt><br>
(run&nbsp;(cc&nbsp;,file&nbsp;-o&nbsp;,binary&nbsp;,@flags)).</tt></blockquote>
Backquote completely avoids the parsing issue because it deals
with pre-parsed data: it constructs expressions from lists, not character
strings.
When the programmer computes a list of arguments, he has complete
confidence that they will be passed to the program exactly as is,
without running the risk of being re-parsed by the shell.<p>
