<h1><a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_Temp_1">Prologue</a></h1><p>Shell programming terrifies me. There is something about writing a simple
shell script that is just much, much more unpleasant than writing a simple C
program, or a simple C<small>O</small><small>M</small><small>M</small><small>O</small><small>N</small> L<small>I</small><small>S</small><small>P</small> program, or a simple Mips assembler program.
Is it trying to remember what the rules are for all the different quotes? Is
it having to look up the multi-phased interaction between filename expansion,
shell variables, quotation, backslashes and alias expansion? Maybe it's having
to subsequently look up which of the twenty or thirty flags I need for my
grep, sed, and awk invocations. Maybe it just gets on my nerves that I have to
run two complete programs simply to count the number of files in a directory
(<tt>ls | wc -l</tt>), which seems like several orders of magnitude more cycles 
than was really needed.</p>
<p>
Whatever it is, it's an object lesson in angst. Furthermore, during late-night
conversations with office mates and graduate students, I have formed the
impression that I am not alone. In late February<a name="call_footnote_Temp_2"></a><a href="#footnote_Temp_2"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a>, I got embroiled in a multi-way email flamefest about just exactly what it
was about Unix that drove me nuts. In the midst of the debate, I did a rash
thing.  I claimed that it would be easy and so much nicer to do shell
programming from Scheme. Some functions to interface to the OS and a few
straightforward macros would suffice to remove the spectre of <tt>#!/bin/csh</tt>
from my life forever.  The serious Unix-philes in the debate expressed their
doubts.  So I decided to go do it.</p>
<p>
Probably only take a week or two.</p>
