<h1><a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;Unix shells</a></h1><p>
Unix shells, such as sh or csh, provide two things at once: an interactive
command language and a programming language. Let us focus on the latter
function: the writing of ``shell scripts'' -- interpreted programs
that perform small tasks or assemble a collection of Unix tools into
a single application.</p>
<p>
Unix shells are real programming languages. They have variables, if/then
conditionals, and loops. But they are terrible programming languages.  The
data structures typically consist only of integers and vectors of strings.
The facilities for procedural abstraction are non-existent to minimal. The
lexical and syntactic structures are multi-phased, unprincipled, and baroque.</p>
<p>
If most shell languages are so awful, why does anyone use them?
There are a few important reasons.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A programming language is a notation for expressing computation.  Shells
have a notation that is specifically tuned for running Unix programs and
hooking them together. For example, suppose you want to run programs
<tt>foo</tt> and <tt>bar</tt> with <tt>foo</tt> feeding output into <tt>bar</tt>. If you do
this in C, you must write: two calls to <tt>fork()</tt>, two calls to
<tt>exec()</tt>, one call to <tt>pipe()</tt>, several calls to <tt>close()</tt>, 
two calls to <tt>dup()</tt>, and a lot of error checks (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#node_fig_Temp_4">1</a>). 
This is a lot of picky bookkeeping: tedious to write, tedious to read, 
and easy to get wrong on the first try. In sh, on the other hand, 
you simply write ``<tt>foo | bar</tt>'' which is much easier to write and 
much clearer to read.
One can look at this expression and instantly understand it; 
one can write it and instantly be sure that it is correct.</p>

<li><p>They are interpreted. Debugging is easy and interactive; programs are small.
On my workstation, the ``hello, world'' program is 16kb as a compiled C
program, and 29 bytes as an interpreted sh script.</p>
<p>
In fact, <tt>/bin/sh</tt> is just about the only language interpreter
that a programmer can absolutely rely upon having available
on the system, so this is just about the only reliable way to
get interpreted-code density and know that one's program
will run on any Unix system.</p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p>Because the shell is the programmer's command language, the programmer
is usually very familiar with its commonly-used command-language
subset (this familiarity tails off rapidly, however, as the demands
of shell programming move the programmer out into the dustier recesses
of the language's definition.)
</p>
</ul><p></p>
<p>
There is a tension between the shell's dual role as interactive command
language and shell-script programming language.  A command language should be
terse and convenient to type. It doesn't have to be comprehensible.  Users
don't have to maintain or understand a command they typed into a shell a month
ago. A command language can be ``write-only,'' because commands are thrown
away after they are used.  However, it is important that most commands fit on
one line, because most interaction is through tty drivers that don't let the
user back up and edit a line after its terminating newline has been entered.
This seems like a trivial point, but imagine how irritating it would be if
typical shell commands required several lines of input. Terse notation is
important for interactive tasks.</p>
<p>
Shell syntax is also carefully designed to allow it to be parsed
on-line -- that is, to allow parsing and interpretation to be interleaved.
This usually penalizes the syntax in other ways (for example, consider 
rc's clumsy if/then/else syntax [<a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-17.html#node_bib_8">rc</a>]).</p>
<p>
Programming languages, on the other hand, can be a little more verbose, in
return for generality and readability. The programmer enters programs into a
text editor, so the language can spread out a little more.</p>
<p>
The constraints of the shell's role as command language are one of the
things that make it unpleasant as a programming language. </p>
<p>
The really compelling advantage of shell languages over other programming
languages is the first one mentioned above. Shells provide a powerful
notation for connecting processes and files together. In this respect,
shell languages are extremely well-adapted to the general paradigm of
the Unix operating system.
In Unix, the fundamental computational agents are programs, running
as processes in individual address spaces.
These agents cooperate and communicate among themselves to solve a problem
by communicating over directed byte streams called pipes.
Viewed at this level, Unix is a data-flow architecture.
From this perspective, the shell serves a critical role
as the language designed to assemble the individual computational
agents to solve a particular task.</p>
<p>
As a programming language, this interprocess ``glue'' aspect of the
shell is its key desireable feature.
This leads us to a fairly obvious idea: instead of adding weak
programming features to a Unix process-control language, 
why not add process invocation features to a strong programming language?</p>
<p>
What programming language would make a good base?
We would want a language that was powerful and high-level.
It should allow for implementations based on interactive interpreters, for
ease of debugging and to keep programs small.
Since we want to add new notation to the language, it would help if the
language was syntactically extensible.
High-level features such as automatic storage allocation would help keep
programs small and simple.
Scheme is an obvious choice.
It has all of the desired features, and its weak points, such as it lack of a
module system or its poor performance relative to compiled C on certain
classes of program, do not apply to the writing of shell scripts.</p>
<p>
I have designed and implemented a Unix shell called scsh that is
embedded inside Scheme.
I had the following design goals and non-goals:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The general systems architecture of Unix is cooperating computational
agents that are realised as processes running in separate, protected address
spaces, communicating via byte streams.
The point of a shell language is to act as the glue to connect up these
computational agents.
That is the goal of scsh.
I resisted the temptation to delve into other programming models.
Perhaps cooperating lightweight threads communicating through shared memory
is a better way to live, but it is not Unix.
The goal here was not to come up with a better systems architecture, but
simply to provide a better way to drive Unix.
{Note Agenda}</p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p>I wanted a programming language, not a command language, and I was
unwilling to compromise the quality of the programming language to
make it a better command language. I was not trying to replace use of
the shell as an interactive command language. I was trying to provide
a better alternative for writing shell scripts. So I did not focus
on issues that might be important for a command language, such as job
control, command history, or command-line editing. There are no write-only
notational conveniences. I made no effort to hide the
base Scheme syntax, even though an interactive user might find all
the necessary parentheses irritating.  
(However, see section <a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-14.html#node_sec_12">12</a>.)</p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p>I wanted the result to fit naturally within Scheme. For example, 
this ruled out complex non-standard control-flow paradigms, 
such as awk's or sed's.
</p>
</ul><p></p>
<p>
The result design, scsh, has two dependent components, embedded
within a very portable Scheme system:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A high-level process-control notation.
</p>
<li><p>A complete library of Unix system calls.
</p>
</ul><p>
The process-control notation allows the user to control Unix programs
with a compact notation.
The syscall library gives the programmer full low-level access to the kernel
for tasks that cannot be handled by the high-level notation.
In this way, scsh's functionality spans a spectrum of detail that is
not available to either C or sh.</p>
