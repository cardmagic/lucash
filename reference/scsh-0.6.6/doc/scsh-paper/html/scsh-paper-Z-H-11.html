Scsh can justifiably be criticised for being a florid design.
There are a lot of features -- perhaps too many.
The optional arguments to many procedures, the implicit backquoting, and
the syntax/procedure equivalents are all easily synthesized by the user.
For example, <tt>port-&gt;strings</tt>, <tt>run/strings*</tt>, <tt>run/sexp*</tt>, 
and <tt>run/sexps*</tt> are all trivial compositions and curries of other base
procedures.
The <tt>run/strings</tt> and <tt>run/sexps</tt> forms are easily
written as macros, or simply written out by hand.
Not only does scsh provide the basic <tt>file-attributes</tt> procedure
(<em>i.e.</em>, the <tt>stat()</tt> system call),
it also provides a host of derived procedures: <tt>file-owner</tt>, <tt>file-mode</tt>,
<tt>file-directory?</tt>, and so forth.
Still, my feeling is that it is easier and clearer to read
</p>
<blockquote><tt>(filter file-directory? (directory-files))</tt></blockquote>than
<blockquote><tt><br>
(filter&nbsp;(lambda&nbsp;(fname)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(eq?&nbsp;'directory&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(fileinfo:type&nbsp;(file-attributes&nbsp;fname))))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(directory-files))</tt></blockquote>
A full library can make for clearer user code.<p>
One measure of scsh's design is that the source code consists of
a large number of small procedures: the source code for scsh has 448
top-level definitions; the definitions have an average length of 5 lines of
code.
That is, scsh is constructed by connecting together a lot of
small, composable parts, instead of designing one inflexible monolithic
structure.
These small parts can also be composed and abstracted by the programmer
into his own computational structures.
Thus the total functionality of scsh is greater than more traditional
large systems.</p>
