<h1><a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;System calls</a></h1><p>
We've just seen scsh's high-level process-form notation,
for running programs, creating pipelines, and performing I/O redirection.
This notation is at roughly the same level as traditional Unix shells.
The process-form notation is convenient, but does not provide detailed,
low-level access to the operating system.
This is provided by the second component of scsh: its system-call library.</p>
<p>
Scsh's system-call library is a nearly-complete set of P<small>O</small><small>S</small><small>I</small><small>X</small> bindings,
with some extras, such as symbolic links.
As of this writing, network and terminal i/o controls have still not yet
been implemented; work on them is underway.
Scsh also provides a convenient set of systems programming utility procedures,
such as routines to perform pattern matching on file-names and general strings,
manipulate Unix environment variables, and parse file pathnames.
Although some of the procedures have been described in passing,
a detailed description of the system-call library is beyond the scope of
this note. 
The reference manual [<a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-17.html#node_bib_10">refman</a>] contains the full details.</p>
