<h1><a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_1">1&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</a></h1><p>The central artifact of this paper is a new Unix shell called scsh.
However, I have a larger purpose beyond simply giving a description of
the new system.
It has become fashionable recently to claim that ``language doesn't matter.''
After twenty years of research, operating systems and systems
applications are still mainly written in C and its complex successor, C++.
Perhaps advanced programming languages offer too little for the price they
demand in efficiency and formal rigor.</p>
<p>
I disagree strongly with this position, and
I would like to use scsh, in comparison to other Unix systems programming
languages, to make the point that language <em>does</em> matter.
After presenting scsh in the initial sections of the paper,
I will describe its design principles, 
and make a series of points concerning the effect language design has
upon systems programming.
I will use scsh, C, and the traditional shells as linguistic exemplars,
and show how their various notational and semantic tradeoffs affect
the programmer's task.
In particular, I wish to show that a functional language such as Scheme is an
excellent tool for systems programming.
Many of the linguistic points I will make are well-known to the members of
the systems programming community that employ modern programming
languages, such as DEC SRC's Modula-3 [<a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-17.html#node_bib_6">Nelson</a>].
In this respect, I will merely be serving to recast these ideas in
a different perspective, and perhaps diffuse them more widely.</p>
<p>
The rest of this paper is divided into four parts:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In part one, I will motivate the design of scsh 
(section&nbsp;<a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-4.html#node_sec_2">2</a>), and then give a brief
tutorial on the system 
(<a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-5.html#node_sec_3">3</a>, <a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-6.html#node_sec_4">4</a>).
</p>
<li><p>In part two, I discuss the design issues behind scsh, 
and cover some of the relevant implementation details
(<a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-7.html#node_sec_5">5</a>-<a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-11.html#node_sec_9">9</a>).
</p>
<li><p>Part three concerns systems programming with advanced languages.
I will illustrate my points by comparing scsh to other Unix
programming systems (<a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-12.html#node_sec_10">10</a>, <a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-13.html#node_sec_11">11</a>).
</p>
<li><p>Finally, we conclude, with some indication of future directions
and a few final thoughts.
</p>
</ul><p></p>
