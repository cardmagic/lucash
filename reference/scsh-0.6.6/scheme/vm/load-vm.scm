; To load the VM into Scheme 48:
;   ,exec ,load load-vm.scm
;
; You must have already loaded Pre-Scheme.
;
; Then, for example,
;  (start-vm "=scheme48/../../build/initial.image" 4000000 20000 '#())
; in the user package will start up the VM with the initial image.
; Be patient.  It will take a while.  Running the initial image as
; above on a SGI Indy (100 mhz R4000) it took over 70 minutes to
; get the - prompt.  scheme48.image starts up faster as it does little
; in the way of initialization.  See below for a way to build a small
; image that will start up quickly.
;
; You will need to have a large heap to start with. -h 12000000 works
; for loading the initial image in version 0.35, smaller heaps may also
; work.
;
; To send input to the VM, do the following:
;
;  Breakpoint: Waiting
;  1> ,in interpreter (set! s48-*pending-events?* #t)
;  1> ,proceed
;  (+ 2 3)                             ; this will be read by the loaded VM
;  Call to (schedule-interrupt 200)    ; output noise
;  Call to (schedule-interrupt 200)
;  Call to (schedule-interrupt 200)
;  5                                   ; the answer
;  > Call to (schedule-interrupt 200)  ; prompt by the loaded S48
;
;  Breakpoint: Waiting
;  1>                                  ; prompt by the base S48
;
; There can't be a pause between the `,proceed 0' and the input for
; the loaded VM.  This is easy to accomplish running under Emacs.
; If there is a pause you will hit the breakpoint again and the
; `(+ 2 3)' or whatever will be read by the base system.
;
; It is easier to debug changes to the VM using images smaller than
; the usual build/initial.image and scheme48.image.  What I usually
; do is modify scheme/debug/tiny.scm so that it runs the code I want
; to test and then build scheme/debug/tiny.image.  The version that
; comes with the system prints `Hello' and the first command argument,
; if any, then reads a line from standard input and prints it to
; standard output.  The image file is less than 12k bytes in size so
; it starts up much faster than the larger images.  Here is a transcript:
;
;    % make scheme/debug/tiny.image
;    (echo ',batch' && echo ',bench on'; \
;    echo \(load-configuration \"scheme/debug/tiny-packages.scm\"\); \
;    echo \(link-simple-system \'\(scheme/debug tiny\) \'start tiny-system\)) \
;    | ./scheme48vm -h 5000000 -i build/linker.image
;    Welcome to Scheme 48 0.45 (suspended image).
