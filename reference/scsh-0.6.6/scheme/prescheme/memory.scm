; An implementation of Pre-Scheme's memory interface that can detect some
; stray reads and writes.  It has numerous limitiations:
;    Allocations are always on page boundaries.
;    No more than 16 megabytes can be allocated at once.
;    More than 32 or 64 or so allocations result in addresses being
;       bignums (dealloctions have no effect on this).
;
; Memory is represented as a vector of byte-vectors, with each byte-vector
; representing a 16-megabyte page.  Allocations are always made on page
; boundaries, so the byte-vectors only need be as large as the allocated
; areas.  Pages are never re-used.
;
; (Scheme 48 still calls byte-vectors code-vectors.)


; Addresses are distinct from integers.
