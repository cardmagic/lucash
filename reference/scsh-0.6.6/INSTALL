			   Installing scsh

This file describes how to install scsh from the source package. If
you have obtained the source tree from CVS refer to the file
CVS_README.

1.  Configure the package for your system.

    Just `cd' to the directory containing this README file and type

	./configure
	
    You can pass some additional options to the configure script, along
    them the installation directory with the
    --prefix=/my/install/location option. Type ./configure --help to
    get a list of all switches.
    Running `configure' takes a minute or two.  While it is running, it
    prints some messages that tell what it is doing. Consult the file
    config.log if anything went wrong.

2.  Type

	make 
   
    to compile scsh.

3.  After a successful build you can invoke scsh by typing 

	./go

    You should see the command prompt of scsh which you can exit by
    typing `,exit'.

4.  Type 

	make install

     to install programs, data files, and documentation.

5.  You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
    source directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
    Makefile, the header file containing system-dependent definitions
    , `config.status' and `config.cache' (all the files that
    `configure' created), type `make distclean'.

For more information about scsh have a look into the README file and
the documentation in the `doc/' directory. There you can also read
documentation about Scheme 48, the Scheme implementation scsh is based
on.
