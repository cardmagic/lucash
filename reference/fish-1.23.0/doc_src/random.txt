\section random random - generate random number

\subsection random-synopsis Synopsis
 <tt>random [SEED]</tt>

\subsection random-description Description

The \c random command is used to generate a random number in the
interval 0<=N<32767. If an argument is given, it is used to seed the
random number generator. This can be useful for debugging purposes,
where it can be desirable to get the same random number sequence
multiple times. If the random number generator is called without first
seeding it, the current time will be used as the seed.

\subsection random-example Example

The following code will count down from a random number to 1:

<pre>
for i in (seq (random) -1 1)
	echo $i
	sleep
end
</pre>
