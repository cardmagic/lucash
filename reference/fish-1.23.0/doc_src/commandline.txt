\section commandline commandline - set or get the current commandline buffer

\subsection commandline-synopsis Synopsis
<tt>commandline [OPTIONS] [CMD]</tt>

\subsection commandline-description Description


- \c CMD is the new value of the commandline. If unspecified, the
  current value of the commandline is written to standard output. All
  output from the commandline builtin is escaped, i.e. quotes are
  removed, backslash escapes are expanded, etc..

The following switches change what the commandline builtin does

- \c -C or \c --cursor set or get the current cursor position, not 
  the contents of the buffer. If no argument is given, the current
  cursor position is printed, otherwise the argument is interpreted 
  as the new cursor position.
- \c -f or \c --function inject readline functions into the
  reader. This option can not be combined with any other option. It
  will cause any additional arguments to be interpreted as readline
  functions, and these functions will be injected into the reader, so
  that they will be returned to the reader before any additional
  actual key presses are read.


The following switches change the way \c commandline updates the
commandline buffer

- \c -a or \c --append do not remove the current commandline, append
  the specified string at the end of it
- \c -i or \c --insert do not remove the current commandline, insert
  the specified string at the current cursor position
- \c -r or \c --replace remove the current commandline and replace it
  with the specified string (default)

The following switches change what part of the commandline is printed
or updated

- \c -b or \c --current-buffer select the entire buffer (default)
- \c -j or \c --current-job select the current job
- \c -p or \c --current-process select the current process
- \c -t or \c --current-token select the current token.

The following switch changes the way \c commandline prints the current
commandline buffer 

- \c -c or \c --cut-at-cursor only print selection up until the
  current cursor position
- \c -o or \c --tokenize tokenize the selection and print one string-type token per line


If commandline is called during a call to complete a given string
using <code>complete -C STRING</code>, commandline will consider the
specified string to be the current contents of the commandline.

\subsection commandline-example Example

<tt>commandline -j $history[3]</tt>

replaces the job under the cursor with the third item from the
commandline history.
