\fCfishd [(-h|--help|-v|--version)]\fP
.SS "Description"
The \fCfishd\fP daemon is used to load, save and distribute universal variable information. fish automatically connects to fishd via a socket on startup. If no instance of fishd is running, fish spawns a new fishd instance. fishd will create a socket in /tmp, and wait for incoming connections from universal variable clients, such as fish, When no clients are connected, fishd will automatically shut down.

.SS "Files"
\fC~/\fP.config/fish/fishd.HOSTNAME permanent storage location for universal variable data. The data is stored as a set of \fCset\fP and \fCset_export\fP commands such as would be parsed by fishd. The file must always be stored in ASCII format. If an instance of fishd is running (which is generally the case), manual modifications to ~/.fishd.HOSTNAME will be lost. Do NOT edit this file manually!
.PP
\fC/tmp/fishd\fP.socket.USERNAME the socket which fishd uses to communicate with all clients.
.PP
/tmp/fishd.log.USERNAME the fishd log file
