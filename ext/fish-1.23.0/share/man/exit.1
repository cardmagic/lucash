\fCexit [STATUS]\fP
.SS "Description"
The \fCexit\fP builtin causes fish to exit. If \fCSTATUS\fP is supplied, it will be converted to an integer and used as the exit code. Otherwise the exit code will be that of the last command executed.
.PP
If exit is called while sourcing a file (using the . builtin) the rest of the file will be skipped, but the shell itself will not exit.
