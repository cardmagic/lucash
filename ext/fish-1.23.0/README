How to find documentation for fish
==================================

The fish documentation is distributed in an intermediate format. To
view it, you have to type:

  % make user_doc

Which will create the directory user_doc, containing html
documentation for fish. If you build and install fish, the
documentation will be available through the 'help' builtin.

After installation, you can start fish by typing fish in the
terminal. After fish has started, try using the help command for more
information.
