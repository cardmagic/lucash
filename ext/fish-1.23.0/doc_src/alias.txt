\subsection alias-description Description

Alias is a shellscript wrapper around the function builtin.
It exists for backwards compatibility with Posix
shells. For other uses, it is recommended to define a <a
href='#function'>function</a>.

Alias does not keep track of which functions have been defined using
alias, nor does it allow erasing of aliases. 

- NAME is the name of the function to define
- DEFINITION is the body of the function. The string " $argv" will be appended to the body.
