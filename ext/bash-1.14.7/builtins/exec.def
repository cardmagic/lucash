$BUILTIN exec
$FUNCTION exec_builtin
$SHORT_DOC exec [ [-] file [redirection ...]]
Exec FILE, replacing this shell with the specified program.
If FILE is not specified, the redirections take effect in this
shell.  If the first argument is `-', then place a dash in the
zeroth arg passed to FILE.  If the file cannot be exec'ed and
the shell is not interactive, then the shell exits, unless the
shell variable "no_exit_on_failed_exec" exists.
