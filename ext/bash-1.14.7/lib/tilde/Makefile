# This Makefile is hand made from a template file, found in

# targets: `all', `clean', `documentation', `install', and
# `what-tar'.  The `what-tar' target reports the names of the
# files that need to be included in a tarfile to build the full
# code and documentation for this library.

# Please note that the values for INCLUDES, CC, AR, RM, CP,
# RANLIB, and selfdir are passed in from ../Makefile, and do
# not need to be defined here.
