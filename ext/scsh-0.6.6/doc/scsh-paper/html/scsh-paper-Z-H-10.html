<h1><a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation</a></h1><p></p>
<p>
Scsh is currently implemented on top of Scheme 48, a freely-available
Scheme implementation written by Kelsey and Rees [<a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-17.html#node_bib_11">S48</a>].
Scheme 48 uses a byte-code interpreter for portability, good code density,
and medium efficiency. It is R4RS-compliant, and includes a module
system designed by Rees.</p>
<p>
The scsh design is not Scheme 48-specific, although the current implementation
is necessarily so. Scsh is intended to be implementable in other Scheme
implementations -- although such a port may require some work. (I would
be very interested to see scsh ported to some of the Scheme systems designed
to serve as embedded command languages -- <em>e.g.</em>, elk, esh, or any of the other
C-friendly interpreters.)</p>
<p>
Scsh scripts currently have a few problems owing to the current
Scheme 48 implementation technology. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before running even the smallest shell script, the Scheme 48 vm must first 
load in a 1.4Mb heap image.  This i/o load adds a few seconds to the startup
time of even trivial shell scripts.</p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p>Since the entire Scheme 48 and scsh runtime is in the form of byte-code
data in the Scheme heap, the heap is fairly large. As the Scheme 48 vm
uses a non-generational gc, all of this essentially permanent data
gets copied back and forth by the collector.</p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p>The large heap size is compounded by Unix forking. 
If you run a
four-stage pipeline, <em>e.g.</em>,
</p>
<blockquote><tt><br>
(run&nbsp;(|&nbsp;(zcat&nbsp;paper.tex.Z)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(detex)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(spell)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(enscript&nbsp;-2r)))</tt></blockquote>
then, for a brief instant, you could have up to five copies of scsh 
forked into existence. This would briefly quintuple the virtual memory
demand placed by a single scsh heap, which is fairly large to begin with. 
Since all the code is actually in the data pages of the process, the OS
can't trivially share pages between the processes. Even if the OS is clever
enough to do copy-on-write page sharing, it may insist on reserving enough
backing store on disk for worst-case swapping requirements. If disk space
is limited, this may overflow the paging area, causing the <tt>fork()</tt>
operations to fail.
</ul><p>
Byte-coded virtual machines are intended to be a technology
that provides memory savings through improved code density.
It is ironic that the straightforward implementation of such a byte-code
interpreter actually has high memory cost through bad interactions with
Unix <tt>fork()</tt> and the virtual memory system.</p>
<p>
The situation is not irretrievable, however.  A recent release of Scheme 48
allows the pure portion of a heap image to be statically linked with the
text pages of the vm binary. Putting static data -- such as all the code for
the runtime -- into the text pages should drastically shorten start-up time,
move a large amount of data out of the heap, improve paging, 
and greatly shrink the dynamic size.  This should all lessen
the impact of <tt>fork()</tt> on the virtual memory system.</p>
<p>
Arranging for the garbage collector to communicate with the virtual memory
system with the near-standard <tt>madvise()</tt> system call would further improve
the system. Also, breaking the system run-time into separate modules (<em>e.g.</em>,
bignums, list operations, i/o, string operations, scsh operations, compiler,
<em>etc.</em>), each of which can be demand-loaded shared-text by the Scheme 48 vm
(using <tt>mmap()</tt>), will allow for a full-featured system with a surprisingly
small memory footprint.</p>
