Perhaps the most difficult part of the design of scsh was the integration
of Scheme ports and Unix file descriptors.
Dealing with Unix file descriptors in a Scheme environment is difficult. 
In Unix, open files are part of the process state, and are referenced
by small integers called <em>file descriptors</em>. 
Open file descriptors are the fundamental way i/o redirections are passed to
subprocesses, since file descriptors are preserved across <tt>fork()</tt>
and <tt>exec()</tt> calls.</p>
<p>
Scheme, on the other hand, uses ports for specifying i/o sources.  
Ports are anonymous, garbage-collected Scheme objects, not integers.  
When a port is collected, it is also closed.  Because file
descriptors are just integers, it's impossible to garbage collect them -- in
order to close file descriptor 3, you must prove that the process will never
again pass a 3 as a file descriptor to a system call doing I/O, and that it
will never <tt>exec()</tt> a program that will refer to file descriptor 3.</p>
<p>
This is difficult at best.</p>
<p>
If a Scheme program only used Scheme ports, and never directly used
file descriptors, this would not be a problem. 
But Scheme code must descend to the file-descriptor level in at least two
circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>when interfacing to foreign code;
</p>
<li><p>when interfacing to a subprocess.
</p>
</ul><p>
This causes problems. Suppose we have a Scheme port constructed
on top of file descriptor 2. We intend to fork off a C program that
will inherit this file descriptor. If we drop references to the port,
the garbage collector may prematurely close file 2 before we exec
the C program. </p>
<p>
Another difficulty arising between the anonymity of ports
and the explicit naming of file descriptors arises when the
user explicitly manipulates file descriptors, as is required by
Unix.
For example, when a file port is opened in Scheme, the underlying run-time
Scheme kernel must open a file and allocate an integer file descriptor.
When the user subsequently explicitly manipulates particular file descriptors,
perhaps preparatory to executing some Unix subprocess, the port's 
underlying file descriptor could be silently redirected to some new file.</p>
<p>
Scsh's Unix i/o interface is intended to fix this and 
other problems arising from the mismatch between ports and file descriptors.
The fundamental principle is that in scsh, most ports are attached to files,
not to particular file descriptors.
When the user does an i/o redirection (<em>e.g.</em>, with <tt>dup2()</tt>)
that must allocate a particular file descriptor <i>fd</i>, there is a chance
that <i>fd</i> has already been inadvertently allocated to a port by a prior
operation (<em>e.g.</em>, an <tt>open-input-file</tt> call).
If so, <i>fd</i>'s original port will be shifted to some new file descriptor 
with a <tt>dup(<i>fd</i>)</tt> operation, freeing up <i>fd</i> for use.
The port machinery is allowed to do this as it does not in general
reveal which file descriptors are allocated to particular Scheme ports.
Not revealing the particular file descriptors allocated to Scheme
ports allows the system two important freedoms:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When the user explicitly allocates a particular file descriptor,
the run-time system is free to shuffle around the port/file-descriptor
associations as required to free up that descriptor.
</p>
<li><p>When all pointers to an unrevealed file port have been dropped, 
the run-time system is free to close the underlying file descriptor.
If the user doesn't know which file descriptor was associated with the
port, then there is no way he could refer to that i/o channel by its
file-descriptor name.
This allows scsh to close file descriptors during gc or when
performing an <tt>exec()</tt>.
</p>
</ul><p>
Users <em>can</em> explicitly manipulate file descriptors, if so desired.
In this case, the associated ports are marked by the run time as ``revealed,''
and are no longer subject to automatic collection.
The machinery for handling this is carefully marked in the documentation, 
and with some simple invariants in mind, follow the user's intuitions.
This facility preserves the transparent close-on-collect property
for file ports that are used in straightforward ways, yet allows
access to the underlying Unix substrate without interference from
the garbage collector. This is critical, since shell programming
absolutely requires access to the Unix file descriptors, as their
numerical values are a critical part of the process interface.</p>
<p>
Under normal circumstances, all this machinery just works behind the scenes
to keep things straightened out. The only time the user has to think about
it is when he starts accessing file descriptors from ports, which he should
almost never have to do. If a user starts asking what file descriptors
have been allocated to what ports, he has to take responsibility for managing
this information.</p>
<p>
Further details on the port mechanisms in scsh are beyond the scope of
this note; for more information, see the reference manual [<a href="scsh-paper-Z-H-17.html#node_bib_10">refman</a>].</p>
