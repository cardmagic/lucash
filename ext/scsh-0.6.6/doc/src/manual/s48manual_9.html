<H2>Module system</H2>

<P>This section gives a brief description of modules and related entities.
For detailed information, including a description of the module
 configuration language, see 
<A HREF="s48manual_24.html">the module chapter</A>.
<P>A <EM>module</EM> is an isolated namespace, with visibility of bindings
 controlled by module descriptions written in a special
 configuration language.
A module may be instantiated as a <EM>package</EM>, which is an environment
 in which code can be evaluated.
Most modules are instantiated only once and so have a unique package.
A <EM>structure</EM> is a subset of the bindings in a package.
Only by being included in a structure can a binding be
 made visible in other packages.
A structure has two parts, the package whose bindings are being exported
 and the set of names that are to be exported.
This set of names is called an <EM>interface</EM>.
A module then has three parts:
<UL><LI>a set of structures whose bindings are to be visible within the module
<LI>the source code to be evaluated within the module
<LI>a set of exported interfaces
</UL>
Instantiating a module produces a package and a set of structures, one for
 each of the exported interfaces.
<P>The following example uses <CODE>define-structure</CODE> to create a module that
 implements simple cells as pairs, instantiates this module, and binds the
 resulting structure to <CODE>cells</CODE>.
The syntax <CODE>(export <CODE><I>name&nbsp;...</I></CODE>)</CODE> creates an interface
 containing <CODE><I>name&nbsp;...</I></CODE>.
The <CODE>open</CODE> clause lists structures whose bindings are visible
 within the module.
The <CODE>begin</CODE> clause contains source code.
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
(define-structure cells (export make-cell
                                cell-ref
                                cell-set!)
  (open scheme)
  (begin (define (make-cell x)
           (cons 'cell x))
         (define cell-ref cdr)
         (define cell-set! set-cdr!)))
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Cells could also have been implemented using the
<A HREF="s48manual_42.html">record facility</A>
 and available in structure <CODE>define-record-type</CODE>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
(define-structure cells (export make-cell
                                cell-ref
                                cell-set!)
  (open scheme define-record-types)
  (begin (define-record-type cell :cell
           (make-cell value)
           cell?
           (value cell-ref cell-set!))))
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>With either definition the resulting structure can be used in other
 modules by including <CODE>cells</CODE> in an <CODE>open</CODE> clause.
<P>The command interpreter is always operating within a particular package.
Initially this is a package in which only the standard Scheme bindings
 are visible.
The bindings of other structures can be made visible by using the 
<A HREF="s48manual_15.html"><CODE>,open</CODE> command</A>.
<P>Note that this initial package does not include the configuration language.
Module code needs to be evaluated in the configuration package, which can
 be done by using the <CODE>,</CODE>config command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&gt; ,config (define-structure cells ...)
&gt; ,open cells
&gt; (make-cell 4)
'(cell . 4)
&gt; (define c (make-cell 4))
&gt; (cell-ref c)
4
