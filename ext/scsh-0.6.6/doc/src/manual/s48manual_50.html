<TITLE>Scheme 48 Manual -- Available facilities</TITLE>

<EM>Scheme 48 Manual</EM> | <A HREF="s48manual.html#top_node">Contents</A> | In Chapter: <A HREF="s48manual_49.html">Mixing Scheme 48 and C</A><BR>Previous: <A HREF="s48manual_50.html">Available facilities</A> | Next: <A HREF="s48manual_50.html">Available facilities</A>
<H2>Available facilities</H2>

<P>The following facilities are available for interfacing between
 Scheme&nbsp;48 and C:
<UL><LI>Scheme code can call C functions.
<LI>The external interface provides full introspection for all
  Scheme objects.  External code may inspect, modify, and allocate
  Scheme objects arbitrarily.
<LI>External code may raise exceptions back to Scheme&nbsp;48 to
  signal errors.
<LI>External code may call back into Scheme.  Scheme&nbsp;48
  correctly unrolls the process stack on non-local exits.
<LI>External modules may register bindings of names to values with a 
  central registry accessible from
  Scheme.  Conversely, Scheme code can register shared
  bindings for access by C code.
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="1">Scheme structures</A></H3>
<P>The structure <CODE>external-calls</CODE> has 
 most of the Scheme functions described here.
The others are in 
 <CODE>dynamic-externals</CODE>, which has the functions for dynamic loading and
 name lookup from

the section on <A HREF="s48manual_54.html">Dynamic Loading</A>,
 and <CODE>shared-bindings</CODE>, which has the additional shared-binding functions
 described in

the section on the <A HREF="s48manual_51.html#more-shared-bindings">complete shared-binding interface</A>.
<P><H3><A NAME="2">C naming conventions</A></H3>
<P>The names of all of Scheme&nbsp;48's visible C bindings begin 
 with `<CODE>s48_</CODE>' (for procedures and variables) or 
 `<CODE>S48_</CODE>' (for macros).
Whenever a C name is derived from a Scheme identifier, we
 replace `<CODE>-</CODE>' with `<CODE>_</CODE>' and convert letters to lowercase
 for procedures and uppercase for macros.
A final `<CODE>?</CODE>'  converted to `<CODE>_p</CODE>' (`<CODE>_P</CODE>' in C macro names).
A final `<CODE>!</CODE>' is dropped.
Thus the C macro for Scheme's <CODE>pair?</CODE> is <CODE>S48_PAIR_P</CODE> and
 the one for <CODE>set-car!</CODE> is <CODE>S48_SET_CAR</CODE>.
Procedures and macros that do not check the types of their arguments
 have `<CODE>unsafe</CODE>' in their names.
<P>All of the C functions and macros described have prototypes or definitions
 in the file <CODE>c/scheme48.h</CODE>.
The C type for Scheme values is defined there to be <CODE>s48_value</CODE>.
<P><H3><A NAME="3">Garbage collection</A></H3>
<P>Scheme&nbsp;48 uses a copying garbage collector.
The collector must be able to locate all references
 to objects allocated in the Scheme&nbsp;48 heap in order to ensure that
 storage is not reclaimed prematurely and to update references to objects
 moved by the collector.
The garbage collector may run whenever an object is allocated in the heap.
C variables whose values are Scheme&nbsp;48 objects and which are live across
 heap allocation calls need to be registered with
 the
<A HREF="s48manual_58.html">garbage collector</A>.
