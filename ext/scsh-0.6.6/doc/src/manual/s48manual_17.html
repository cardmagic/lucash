<H2>Switches</H2>
<P>There are a number of binary switches that control the behavior of the
 command processor.
<P>The switches are as follows:
<DL><DT><B></B><DD><CODE>batch [on | off]</CODE><BR>In `batch mode' any error or interrupt that comes up will cause
    Scheme&nbsp;48 to exit immediately with a non-zero exit status.  Also,
    the command processor doesn't print prompts.  Batch mode is
    off by default.
<P><DT><B></B><DD><CODE>,levels [on | off]</CODE><BR>Enables or disables the automatic pushing of a new command level when
    an error, interrupt, or other breakpoint occurs.
    When enabled (the default), breakpoints push a new command level,
    and <I>&lt;</I>eof<I>&gt;</I> (see above)
    or <CODE>,reset</CODE> is required to return to top level.  The effects of
    pushed command levels include:
<UL><LI>a longer prompt
<LI>retention of the continuation in effect at the point of errors
<LI>confusion among some newcomers
</UL>
    With <CODE>levels</CODE> disabled one must issue a
    <CODE>,push</CODE> command immediately
    following an error in order to retain the error continuation for
    debugging purposes; otherwise the continuation is lost as soon as
    the focus object changes.  If you don't know anything about the
    available debugging tools, then levels might as well be disabled.
<P><DT><B></B><DD><CODE>break-on-warnings [on | off]</CODE><BR>Enter a new command level when a warning is produced, just as
    when an error occurs.  Normally warnings only result in a displayed
    message and the program does not stop executing.
</DL>
