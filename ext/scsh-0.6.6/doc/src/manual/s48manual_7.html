<H2>Performance</H2>

<P>If you want to generally have your code run faster than it normally
would, enter <CODE>inline-values</CODE> mode before loading anything.  Otherwise
calls to primitives (like <CODE>+</CODE> and <CODE>cons</CODE>) and in-line procedures
(like <CODE>not</CODE> and <CODE>cadr</CODE>) won't be open-coded, and programs will run
more slowly.
<P>The system doesn't start in <CODE>inline-values</CODE> mode by default because the
Scheme report permits redefinitions of built-in procedures.  With
this mode set, such redefinitions don't work according to the report,
because previously compiled calls may have in-lined the old
definition, leaving no opportunity to call the new definition.
<P><CODE>Inline-values</CODE> mode is controlled by the <CODE>inline-values</CODE> switch.
<CODE>,set inline-values</CODE> and <CODE>,unset inline-values</CODE> turn it on and off.
