<H2>Calling Scheme functions from C</H2>

<P>External code that has been called from Scheme can call back to Scheme
 procedures using the following function.
<P><UL><LI><CODE>scheme_value s48_call_scheme(s48_value p, long nargs, ...)</CODE>
</UL>
This calls the Scheme procedure <CODE>p</CODE> on <CODE>nargs</CODE>
 arguments, which are passed as additional arguments to <CODE>s48_call_scheme</CODE>.
There may be at most twelve arguments.
The value returned by the Scheme procedure is returned by the C procedure.
Invoking any Scheme procedure may potentially cause a garbage collection.
<P>There are some complications that occur when mixing calls from C to Scheme
 with continuations and threads.
C only supports downward continuations (via <CODE>longjmp()</CODE>).
Scheme continuations that capture a portion of the C stack have to follow the
 same restriction.
For example, suppose Scheme procedure <CODE>s0</CODE> captures continuation <CODE>a</CODE>
 and then calls C procedure <CODE>c0</CODE>, which in turn calls Scheme procedure
 <CODE>s1</CODE>.
Procedure <CODE>s1</CODE> can safely call the continuation <CODE>a</CODE>, because that
 is a downward use.
When <CODE>a</CODE> is called Scheme&nbsp;48 will remove the portion of the C stack used
 by the call to <CODE>c0</CODE>.
On the other hand, if <CODE>s1</CODE> captures a continuation, that continuation
 cannot be used from <CODE>s0</CODE>, because by the time control returns to
 <CODE>s0</CODE> the C stack used by <CODE>c0</CODE> will no longer be valid.
An attempt to invoke an upward continuation that is closed over a portion
 of the C stack will raise an exception.
<P>In Scheme&nbsp;48 threads are implemented using continuations, so the downward
 restriction applies to them as well.
An attempt to return from Scheme to C at a time when the appropriate
 C frame is not on top of the C stack will cause the current thread to
 block until the frame is available.
For example, suppose thread <CODE>t0</CODE> calls a C procedure which calls back
 to Scheme, at which point control switches to thread <CODE>t1</CODE>, which also
 calls C and then back to Scheme.
At this point both <CODE>t0</CODE> and <CODE>t1</CODE> have active calls to C on the
 C stack, with <CODE>t1</CODE>'s C frame above <CODE>t0</CODE>'s.
If thread <CODE>t0</CODE> attempts to return from Scheme to C it will block,
 as its frame is not accessible.
Once <CODE>t1</CODE> has returned to C and from there to Scheme, <CODE>t0</CODE> will
 be able to resume.
The return to Scheme is required because context switches can only occur while
 Scheme code is running.
<CODE>T0</CODE> will also be able to resume if <CODE>t1</CODE> uses a continuation to
 throw past its call to C.
