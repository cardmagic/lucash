; Generated names

; Generated names make lexically-scoped macros work.  They're the same
; as what Alan Bawden and Chris Hanson call "aliases".  The parent
; field is always another name (perhaps generated).  The parent chain
; provides an access path to the name's binding, should one ever be
; needed.  That is: If name M is bound to a transform T that generates
; name G as an alias for name N, then M is (generated-parent-name G),
; so we can get the binding of G by accessing the binding of N in T's
; environment of closure, and we get T by looking up M in the
; environment in which M is *used*.

; Qualified names
; 
; A qualified name is a generated name that has been translated into a path.
; For example, if syntax A introduces a reference to procedure B, then the
; reference to B, as a qualified name, will be #(>> A B).  If B refers to
; C and is substituted in-line, then the reference to C is #(>> #(>> A B) C).
; The binding for C can be located by going to the structure which supplies A,
; finding where it gets B from, and then looking up C there.

; These can't be records because they are included in linked images.
