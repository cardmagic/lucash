/* Unix #! shell scripts are not recursive. The interpreter you specify
** on the #! line cannot itself be a shell script. This is a problem for
** the Scheme shell, since it is implemented as a heap image executed
** by the Scheme 48 vm. This means that users cannot write shell scripts
** of the form:
**     #!/usr/local/bin/scsh -s
**     !#
**     ...Scheme code goes here...
**
** They must instead write:
**     #!/usr/local/lib/scsh/scshvm \
**     -o /usr/local/lib/scsh/scshvm -i /usr/local/lib/scsh/scsh.image -s
**     ...Scheme code goes here...
**
** This is gruesome and probably confusing to novices.
**
** What we do is have this tiny little stub program play the role of scsh.
** It is compiled to a real Unix binary, but when it is executed, it simply
** execs the scsh virtual machine, passing it an argv composed of
**     { "-o" "scshvm" "-i" "scsh.image"}
** prepended to whatever argv it was given. Now you can write shell scripts
** with
**     #!/usr/local/bin/scsh -s
** triggers.
**
** There are two downsides to doing things this way.
** 1. You pay an extra exec(2) at startup time. 
**    And scsh starts up slow enough as it is.
** 2. You cannot specify extra arguments for the vm this way. The most
**    important one you might want to specify is the heap size arg, -h.
