;;; Unix waitt & process objects for scsh
;;; Copyright (c) 1993, 1994, 1995 by Olin Shivers.

;;; This is a GC'd abstraction for Unix process id's.
; ;; The problem with Unix pids is (a) they clutter up the kernel
;;; process table until you wait(2) them, and (b) you can only
;;; wait(2) them once. Scsh's process objects are similar, but
;;; allow the storage to be allocated in the scsh address space,
;;; and out of the kernel process table, and they can be waited on
;;; multiple times.

;;; Process reaping
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;; "Reaping" a process means using wait(2) to move its exit status from the
;;; kernel's process table into scsh, thus cleaning up the kernel's process
;;; table and saving the value in a gc'd data structure, where it can be
;;; referenced multiple times.
;;;
;;; - Stopped processes are never reaped, only dead ones.  (May change -df)
;;; 
;;; - Stopped process status codes are never cached in proc objects, 
;;;   only status codes for dead processes. So you can wait for a
;;;   dead process multiple times, but only once per process-stop.
;;;   (May change -df)
;;; 
;;; - Unfortunately, reaping a process loses the information specifying its
;;;   process group, so if a process is reaped into scsh, it cannot be
;;;   waited for by WAIT-PROCESS-GROUP. Notice that only dead processes are
;;;   reaped, not suspended ones. Programs almost never use WAIT-PROCESS-GROUP
;;;   to wait for dead processes, so this is not likely to be a problem. If
;;;   it is, turn autoreaping off with (autoreap-policy #f).
;;;   (This never worked right, and it might be wiped out completely -fd)
;;; 
;;; - Reaping can be encouraged by calling (REAP-ZOMBIES).
