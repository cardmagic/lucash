rush BETA
---------

== Requirements
* Ruby 1.8.2
* Updated Curses module (see below)
* ruby-breakpoint
* open4 - http://www.codeforpeople.com/lib/ruby/open4/
* rubygems - optional, remember to set your env, export RUBYOPT=-rubygems

Ruby 1.8.2's curses implementation has a bug which causes
background colors to be mangled/missing. It also misses some
methods we needed.

We submitted a patch, download the curses.c at the bottom:
http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2298&group_id=426&atid=1698

Alternatively you can download a precompiled replacement from:
http://reyn.co.za/curses.so Remember to backup your old one,
it might not work.

== Installation
You can use the provided setup.rb script to
install rush. To do so, just type the following
commands:

 $ ruby setup.rb config
 $ ruby setup.rb setup
 $ ruby setup.rb install

You may need to be root for the last step. To
change the default install locations, see:

http://i.loveruby.net/en/man/setup/index.html

Developers: You should either avoid using the setup.rb
            script altogether or, if necessary, uninstall
            all of the files it has installed in order to
            ensure that the correct files are loaded when
            you test your code.


== Usage notes
- Use export TERM=linux if you have problems with the backspace key
- To override the default config, make a copy of lib/rush/default_config.rb
  and place it in ~/.rushrc. The file is loaded and executed as Ruby code.

Examples
--------
Do the following in order to see what each command does:

1) Expressions:
1+2+3

2) Code completion
"somestring".
"somestring".som<tab>
"somestring".somemethod.<tab>

3) Directory completion
cd /<tab>

4) Internal commands:
ls
ls | b
ls | selector | b

5) External commands
!ls
!ls | b
*ls | b
*ifconfig | selector | b
^vi

6) Aliases
Alias.set("ifconfig","!ifconfig")
ifconfig

7) Builtin keys
* ` makes opens the history browser

Extending
---------
There is still quite alot to be done/fixed on the API
Have a look at one of the builtin command in the commands directory

Current Issues
--------------
We know about:
* Cursor not where it's suppose to be sometimes
* !vi/*vi or any other command that grabs input causes problems/hang
* The file completion isnt 100% yet, yell if you find something not workin
* Blocks are broken, need to write a better parser
* We are not yet sending things like 'puts "hello' to an IO string
* and some others :)
