2001-10-15, RF
	* Added acceptance test for Christian Szegedy's 
	  multiple-unnamed-maybes bug. Not activated yet though...
	* More specific rescue-clause in rockit.rb so that it doesn't catch
	  errors unrelated to loading.
	* Added comment to README on installing from sources grabbed from CVS
	  tree.

2001-10-15, RF
	* Updated utest_eof_token.rb, utest_token.rb, utest_tokenregexp.rb
	  because of changes in 1.7.1 that gave parse errors (when parsing 
	  the test files; has nothing to do with rockit parsing anything)
	* Fixed bug in directed_graph that somehow passed the test in previous
	  Ruby versions. Strange since the methods in question were tested.
	* Fixed bug in utest_syntax_tree since recent Ruby versions raise
	  NoMethodError instead of NameError.
	* Fixed slash-bug in sourcecode_dumpable.rb.

2001-06-19, RF
	* Released as 0.3.7.
	* Fixed som bugs reported by Christian Szegedy that arise when 
	  strscan by Minero Aoki is not installed.
	* Added utest_stringscanner.rb to avoid this problem in the future.
	
2001-06-12, RF
	* Released as version 0.3.6.
	* Applied patch from Dave Thomas that handles Process.times vs 
	  Time.times for different Ruby versions.
	* Found bug in example in README file. Added test to extract and test
	  its correctness to avoid this in the future.
	
2001-06-11, RF
	* Released as version 0.3.5.
	* Some profiling to make generating parser for Ruby grammar possible. 
	  It now takes about 90 seconds which is still slow. Still much room
	  for profiling and speed ups even though its useable.

2001-05-31, RF
	* Reimplemented the LaLrParseTableGenerator to speed it up. Now much 
	  cleaner and faster!

2001-05-25, RF
	* Wrote translator from parse.y to rockit grammars.
	* Changed rockit-grammar.grammar to allow '_' and digits in symbol 
	  names.
	* Found and corrected bug in auto-assignment of children names.

2001-05-24, RF
	* Speeded up parser by caching and reusing lexers. Uses BoundedLruCache
	  to keep mem use down since typically only a handful of lexers are
	  active at the same time.
	* Better error message from AmbigousParseException when the pretty-
	  print of the alternatives are the same.
	* Moved AmbigousParseException to its own file.

2001-05-22, RF
	* Bug fixing and testing on examples.

2001-05-02, RF
	* Redesign of the tree-building, production and code generator-related
	  classes. Much cleaner even though there is still some non-OO
	  heritage left.
	* Conceived and added the "Generalized LR parsing with scanner forking"
	  algorithm. Small extension on Jan Rekers and Eelco Vissers work.
	* Added code so that grammars can be written directly in Ruby.
	* Added lots of tests.
	* Changed minor version from 0.1 to 0.3. Changes are big enough for 
	  that but I don't want to go 0.2 implying a "stable" version.

2001-04-11, RF
	* Started translating the Ruby 1.6.3 grammar. Wasn't happy with how
	  I had to handle lexer states. Something better needed.

2001-04-10, RF
	* Simplified calculator.rb and added test to show lack of precedence 
	  values and associativity.
	* Added mfcalc.rb as yet another example from Bison manual.

2001-04-09, RF
	* Released 0.1.3 to Clemens Wyss
	* Updated README and Manifest for version 0.1.3

2001-04-04, RF
	* Added examples/polynomials from the ANTLR tutorial just to see how 
	  it would be done with rockit.

2001-04-03, RF
	* Released as 0.1.2 to Adam Spitz (AS) and Avi Bryant (AB)
	* Minor speed-up fixes in LALR1ParserGenerator. Left-recursive 
	  grammars à la rpcalc.rb is now significantly faster. Still room for 
	  more speed-ups, by cleaning things up and only using kernels, though.
	
2001-03-07, RF
	* Added rpcalc example.
	* Fixed bug in LALR1ParserGenerator
	* Added test runner and tests of the examples.
	
2001-03-06, RF
	* Released version 0.1.1 to RG, MB and AN
	* Added internal StringScanner that is used if strscan is not
	available.

2001-03-01, Robert Feldt (RF)
	* Released version 0.1 to Mathieu Bouchard (MG), Aleksi Niemelä (AN) 
	  and Robert Gustavsson (RG)
	* minibasic example
	* calculator example
