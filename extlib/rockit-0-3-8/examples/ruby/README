A very rudimentary Ruby parser
------------------------------

Right now it only parser literals!

1. Translate parse.y from Ruby sources (I've only tried with 1.6.3 parse.y
   and there is reported to be a problem with later ones) to a rockit grammar
 
  $ ruby parse_y_to_rockit.rb parse.y ruby.grammar

2. Create parser

  $ rockit ruby.grammar ruby_parser.rb Ruby

3. test it

  $ ruby test.rb

BUT NOTE THAT IT IS VERY RUDIMENTARY AND PROBABLY CANNOT BE USED IN PRACTICE!
NEEDS MORE WORK!!
