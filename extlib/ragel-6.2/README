                     Ragel State Machine Compiler -- README
                     ======================================

1. Build Requirements
---------------------

 * GNU Make
 * g++

If you would like to modify Ragel and need to build Ragel's scanners and
parsers from the specifications then set BUILD_PARSERS=true in the configure
script and then run it. To build the parsers you will need the following
programs:

 * ragel (the most recent version)
 * kelbt (the most recent version)
 * gperf

To build the user guide the following extra programs are needed:

 * fig2dev
 * pdflatex


2. Compilation
--------------

To configure type './configure'. The makefiles honour the --prefix option to
specify where the program is to be installed to.

To build the ragel program type 'make'.

To build all the documentation cd to 'doc' and type 'make'. If you don't have
all of the programs to build the user guide and just want the man page use
'make ragel.1 rlgen-cd.1 rlgen-java.1 rlgen-ruby.1 rlgen-dot.1'


3. Installing
-------------

The command 'make install' will build the programs and install them to
$PREFIX/bin/.  A 'make install' in the doc directory will make and install all
the documentation.  The man pages install to $PREFIX/man/man1/ and the user
guide and ChangeLog install to $PREFIX/share/doc/ragel/. To install just the
man page use 'make man-install'.
